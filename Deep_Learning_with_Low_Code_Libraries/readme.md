2) Hugging Face Transformers API:
  - Text classification
  - Named entity recognition
  - Question answering
  - Text summarization
  - Translation
  - Zero-shot classification
  - Computer vision
  - Audio
  - Table QA

3) Keras-NLP for:
  - Inference with a pre-trained classifier
  - Fine-tuning a pre-trained backbone
  - Fine-tuning with user-controlled preprocessing
  - Fine-tuning custom modes

4) User Keras-CV for various vision tasks

  - Inference with a pre-trained classifier: Detecting a Lion
  - Fine-tuning a pre-trained backbone: Fintuned efficientnetv2_b0_imagenet to classify cells into Malaria infected or not.
  - Training an image classifier from scratch: Trained a classifier for the Fashion Mnist Data
  - Draw inference from pre-trained and then train custom object detection model (using YOLO)
