# Data Augmentation and Generalization techniques:

The series of Colabs enlisted here explore data augmentation, generalization, and regularizations applied during neural network implementations. For a detailed explanation covering all the requirements, refer to the demo video <a href = 'https://youtu.be/HalDBGbjnczopw'> here </a>.
## Below are sneak peeks to some results:
